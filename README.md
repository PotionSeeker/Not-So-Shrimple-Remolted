Not So Shrimple - Remolted

‘Not So Shrimple - Remolted’ is an unofficial continuation of the original mod created by Peeko123 which introduces a series of new crustacean and crustacean-adjacent mobs to the world of Minecraft.

Crayfish
Crayfish are massive aggressive crustaceans with a spiked pincer and crushing claw. They can rarely be found roaming around in swamps.
When killed, they have a chance to drop Crayfish Meat.

Maneater
Maneaters are 6 legged clam-like creatures that can be found near shipwrecks where they sate their appetite for human corpses, hence the name. They can rarely be found around shipwrecks. 
When killed, they have a chance to drop Titanite Shards.
