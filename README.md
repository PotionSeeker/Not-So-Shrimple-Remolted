# About

‘Not So Shrimple - Remolted’ is a mod that introduces a series of crustaceans, molluscs and other shell-adjacent mobs to the world of Minecraft.


# Crayfish

Crayfish are massive aggressive crustaceans with a spiked pincer and crushing claw. They can be found roaming around in swamps and come in a variety of different colors; from an iconic blue to a dreary brown and some might have unique properties.

When killed, they have a chance to drop some delicious Prawn Meat, Somber Smithing Stones, and if your lucky they may even drop their Calloused Claw which can be used to craft a powerful weapon.

# Maneater

Maneaters are 6 legged molluscs that can be found near shipwrecks where they search for bodies to sate their appetite for human flesh.

When killed, they have a chance to drop Purging Stones.

# Plans
*There are a variety of new mobs based on shelled-creatures from other games that I would like to add:
- Unrevealed Mob 1
- Unrevealed Mob 2
- Unrevealed Mob 3
- Unrevealed Mob 4

*Update to 1.21+ : Maybe? Hopefully? Time will tell...
