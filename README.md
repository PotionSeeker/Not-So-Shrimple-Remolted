# About

‘Not So Shrimple - Remolted’ is an unofficial continuation of the original mod created by Peeko123 which introduces a series of new crustaceans and crustacean-adjacent mobs to the world of Minecraft.


# Crayfish

Crayfish are massive aggressive crustaceans with a spiked pincer and crushing claw. They can be found roaming around in swamps and come in a variety of different colors; from an iconic blue to a dreary brown and some might have unique properties.
When killed, they have a chance to drop some delicious meat and if your lucky they may even drop their claw which can be used to craft a powerful weapon.


# Maneater

Maneaters are 6 legged clam-like creatures that can be found near shipwrecks where they sate their appetite for human flesh. They can rarely be found around shipwrecks. 
When killed, they have a chance to drop Stones with unique properties.


# Plans
*There are a variety of new mobs based on crustaceans from other games that I would like to add:
- Unrevealed Mob 1
- Unrevealed Mob 2
- Unrevealed Mob 3
- Unrevealed Mob 4

*Update to 1.21+ : Maybe? Hopefully? Time will tell...
